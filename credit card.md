# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a highly imbalanced dataset, various techniques were applied to preprocess, balance, and train a classifier that distinguishes between genuine and fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud]
The dataset consists of anonymized credit card transactions over a period of two days, with features such as transaction time, amount, and 28 anonymized principal components. The dataset has 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent (~0.17%).

- **Target variable**: `Class` (0 = Genuine, 1 = Fraudulent)

## Key Challenges
- **Class Imbalance**: Only 0.17% of the transactions are fraudulent.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset needed normalization of the `Amount` feature and handling of high-dimensional features (V1-V28).
- **Feature Engineering**: The anonymized dataset required working directly with the provided principal components.

## Steps Followed

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization**: The `Amount` column was normalized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniformity in the data distribution.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to oversample the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

### 2. Model Training
A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained on the preprocessed and balanced dataset. The ensemble method of Random Forest helps capture complex interactions between features, improving the detection of fraudulent transactions.

### 3. Model Evaluation
To measure performance, the following metrics were used:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model’s predictions.
- **Precision**: How many predicted fraud cases were actually fraudulent.
- **Recall**: How many actual fraud cases were detected by the model.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### 4. Techniques for Improvement
- **Tomek Links**: Used to further clean the dataset by removing borderline examples after applying SMOTE.
- **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Incorporated into the Random Forest model to penalize misclassifications of the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

## Results
The Random Forest model performed well in detecting fraudulent transactions. The key performance metrics are as follows:
- **Precision**: ~98%
- **Recall**: ~92%
- **F1-Score**: ~95%
